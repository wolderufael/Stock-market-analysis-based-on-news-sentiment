# The Project is divided into three tasks 
## Task -1
 ## Descriptive Statistics:
* Obtain basic statistics for textual lengths (like headline length).
Count the number of articles per publisher to identify which publishers are most active.
* Analyze the publication dates to see trends over time, such as increased news frequency on particular days or during specific events.
 ## Text Analysis(Sentiment analysis & Topic Modeling):
* Perform sentiment analysis on headlines to gauge the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) associated with the news.
* Use natural language processing to identify common keywords or phrases, potentially extracting topics or significant events (like "FDA approval", "price target", etc.).
## Time Series Analysis:
* How does the publication frequency vary over time? Are there spikes in article publications related to specific market events?
* Analysis of publishing times might reveal if thereâ€™s a specific time when most news is released, which could be crucial for traders and automated trading systems.
## Publisher Analysis:
* Which publishers contribute most to the news feed? Is there a difference in the type of news they report?
* If email addresses are used as publisher names, identify unique domains to see if certain organizations contribute more frequently.
